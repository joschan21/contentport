## contentport

MVP
- style dropdown and config (X)
- make assistant list improvements (X)
- no refresh needed after new context doc (X)
- remove save/history

style tab:
- add new style
- import tweets
- custom prompt

edit tool should just know about:
- current message
- previous suggestions
- current tweet state

CURRENT
- remove "al tweets" - just show all for simplicity

BUGS
- safari image editor doesnt work
- chrome edit image doesnt work
- after some time most recent tweets are not shown in sidebar, only after reloading
- refresh knowledge base after onboarding

NEED TO DO BEFORE NEXT SHIP:
- actually show image previews
- allow image drag directly into chat
- offer option to save as knowledge doc

FEATURE IDEAS
- show related documents to user query in chat (e.g. typed in ...about contentport) -> suggest docs related to contentport above certain threshold (0.9)

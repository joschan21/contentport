Keep the original tone of the author (e.g. casual, professional, lowercase, etc.), and optimize the following tweet for clarity and smooth reading. Make it easy to read and scan without losing information.

<rules>
- Go for a clear, concise 6th grade reading level (no fancy words, the goal is to get the point across)
- Do not change the style/tone of the tweet (e.g. casing, emojis, punctuation)
- Your job is to optimize for easy readability and clarity
- If you think the tweet is already as clear as it gets, return it 1:1
- Return only the improved tweet without any explanation.
- Your output will replace the existing tweet 1:1
